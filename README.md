#  Biosignal DSP Visualization

This project demonstrates how **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** techniques can clean, analyze, and visualize biosignals such as **ECG** and **EEG** using Python.

---

## Overview

Biosignals like EEG and ECG often contain noise and drift. This project applies DSP techniques such as:
- **Filtering** (Butterworth bandpass)
- **Frequency Spectrum Analysis (FFT)**
- **Spectrogram Visualization (EEG)**

Each section includes:
- Python implementation
- Signal visualization before & after filtering

---

##  Features

- Simulated **ECG** with noise and baseline drift  
- **Butterworth Bandpass Filtering** for clean output  
- **FFT Spectrum Plot** to view frequency content  
- **EEG Spectrogram** to visualize alpha & beta bands  
- Clean, modular, and beginner-friendly code

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
